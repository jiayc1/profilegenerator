Description: 

This is a generator that allows HR to create a team and create their profile for view. There are three type of team members you can add which is: 
1. Manager
2. Engineer
3. Intern 

Using terminal, when you run node index.js, you will then be able to answer some questions that will help you fill out an html file. 

There were four tests that were built to test out the application. 
The test include employee test, engineer test, intern test, and manager test.
